1. (100 Points) Using your lexer from Problem Set 1 and your recursive
descent, YACC, or Bison parser from Problem Set 2, develop a complete
symbol table management system.

As your compiler reads the input program being compiled, it should
generate a symbol table in memory which represents all identifiers in
the program.  Each identifier needs to be associated with its
appropriate type data structure that describes the declared type of
the identifier.  This type data structure should be of the form
discussed in class -- it is the data structure shown in the "Type
Checking" slides on the class web site
(http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~libe295/fall2013/slides/Type%20Checking.pdf).
All references to identifiers in the parse tree should be replaced
with pointers into the symbol table.  As in Problem Set 2, all
statements, expressions, and other elements from the grammar should be
replaced by data structures in the parse tree.

Keep in mind that your compiler needs to produce multiple symbol
tables: one for each overloading class and one for each scope.  Our
overloading classes are: (1) statement labels and (2) "other names"
(see Harbison & Steele, page 78, table 4-2).  You will have a possible
symbol table for statement labels for each procedure.  You will have a
possible symbol table for "other names" at file scope, at each
procedure scope, and at each block scope (see Harbison & Steele, page
75, table 4-1).

Errors should be emitted for identifiers that are defined more than
once in the same overloading class in the same scope and also for
references to identifiers that are not declared in that scope or in
any enclosing scope.

As part of this problem set, your compiler needs to ensure that a
procedure prototype declaration and a procedure definition for the
same procedure have the same number of parameters, identical parameter
types, and identical return types.  In addition, all declarations must
be checked to verify that they are for legal types.  For example,
functions are not allowed to return an array type (see Harbison &
Steele at the bottom on page 101 and the top of page 102).  Also,
every parameter must be named in a procedure definition.

All arithmetic types should be converted into canonical types.  For
example, "int," "signed int," and "signed" should all be represented
by the same base type.

For array declarations, the bounds of arrays are allowed to be
constant expressions.  These should be evaluated to an integer
constant as part of this problem set.  You should check that array
indexes are specified when they are required (see Harbison & Steele,
pages 98-99 on Incomplete Array Types).

In addition to pretty printing the parse tree from Problem Set 2, your
compiler should include a facility that dumps the symbol tables in a
meaningful way when the end of the input program has been reached.
All references to identifiers should be tagged in such a way as to
indicate in which symbol table that identifier is declared.  This
should be accomplished by inserting a comment that includes a specific
symbol table tag after each identifier is emitted in the pretty print
of the parse tree.

Remember the solution that you turn in should include a demonstration
that your program works and has been tested.  Thus, the test programs
you use as input and the output that your compiler produces should be
included with your other files.  Also, keep in mind that your solution
must run correctly on the Harvard "ice" machines in the Science Center
(refer to the Grading section in the class syllabus for more
information).

As always, you should use the "submit" utility on the computers in the
Science Center to turn in your completed work.
