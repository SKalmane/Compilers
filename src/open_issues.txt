1. Subscript_expr does not work i.e., atoi(argv[2]) does not type check correctly.
   This is because argv[2] is not parsed correctly in the symbol table phase itself

2. comma_expr does not work i.e., if we have :
   int shift, i;
 - This will not work since comma_expr does not add the symbols to the symbol table correctly
